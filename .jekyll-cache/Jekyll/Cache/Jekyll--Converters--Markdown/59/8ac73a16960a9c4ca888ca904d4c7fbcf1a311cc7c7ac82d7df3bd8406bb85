<p>A Dolphin attack is a term that has been given to the method of accessing a smartphone 
without the users‚Äô consent by executing ultrasonic commands.
A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09537">study</a> conducted at Zhejiang University in China has shown that such speech recognition systems
 are vulnerable to hidden commands that the researchers are calling ‚ÄúDolphin Attacks‚Äù.
How do you hide a voice command? Make it ultrasonic. Humans hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20kHz. 
If you record a phrase, and shift it above 20 kHz, then play it back, you can‚Äôt hear it, but dogs, bats, dolphins and,
 unfortunately, phone and computer microphones can. <a href="https://fraudwatchinternational.com/expert-explanations/what-is-a-dolphin-attack/">from fraud watch international</a></p>

<p>‚ÄúDolphin Attacks‚Äù can be used to <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/news/dolphin-attack-hacking-phones-via-ultrasound/">from UW-Madison</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open malicious websites, which can launch a drive-by-download attack or exploit a device with 0-day vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>Spy on users by initiating outgoing video/phone calls, therefore getting access to video or sound of the devices surroundings.</li>
  <li>Inject fake information by sending fake text messages and emails, online posts, calendar events, etc.</li>
  <li>Deny service, by turning on airplane mode, disconnecting all wireless communications.</li>
  <li>Conceal attacks by dimming the targeted device‚Äôs screen and lowering its speaker volume.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>

<p>In one of the challenges, you get access to this audio:</p>

<audio controls="" src="/assets/sound/dolphin.wav">
<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="/assets/sound/dolphin.wav">link to the audio</a> instead.</p></audio>

<p>Thankfully we had heard about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dolphin attack</code> vector (and the obvious name of the challenge),
 we decided to find out if there was any hidden message in the audio.</p>

<p>The Audio opened in audacity reveals nothing on first hand:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/dolphin-before.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately we did not succeed in attacking ourselves (I guess Apple had patch this flow on their side at the date of the competition).
So after some <a href="https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=95331">looking around</a>, we found how to get the message by demodulating the signal 
in amplitude using a nyquist prompt in Audacity:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">;</span>version 4
    <span class="o">(</span>setf cf 37000<span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">;</span> the carrier frequency
    <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">let</span> <span class="o">((</span>demod <span class="o">(</span>mult <span class="k">*</span>track<span class="k">*</span> <span class="o">(</span>hzosc cf<span class="o">))))</span>
      <span class="o">(</span>lowpass8 demod 10000<span class="o">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically we filter everything under the high frequency and bring to audible level the hidden attack audio:</p>

<audio controls="" src="/assets/sound/dolphin-after.wav">
<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="/assets/sound/dolphin.wav">link to the audio</a> instead.</p></audio>

<p>If you play the audio you should hear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>hey siri go to tinyurl.com/56463452321</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which bring you to <a href="tinyurl.com/56463452321">this image</a> where the flag is (The see weed brownies):</p>
