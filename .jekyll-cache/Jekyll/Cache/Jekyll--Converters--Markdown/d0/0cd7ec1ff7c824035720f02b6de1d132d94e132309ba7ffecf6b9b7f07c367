I"P<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/#overview">Azure</a> AKS (Azure Kubernetes Cluster) is a serverless Kubernetes offer.
Deploy and manage containerized applications more easily with a fully managed Kubernetes service.</p>

<h2 id="azure-kubernetes-service">Azure Kubernetes Service</h2>

<h3 id="create-your-cluster">Create your cluster</h3>

<p>When you log into Azure Cloud you get a lot of possibilities and resources to play with.
Almost everything can be done via the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Cloud Portal</a> (a GUI), but that would be a very bad idea.
The GUI is great to get a look at metrics, existing deployment or for testing around, 
however it is advised to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration-cli">command line</a> as much as possible because more generic and reliable.</p>

<p>Creating a simple Kubernetes cluster with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">az aks</code> which is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az_aks_create">Azure CLI</a>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>az aks create <span class="nt">--resource-group</span> MyResourceGroup <span class="nt">--name</span> MyManagedCluster <span class="nt">--node-count</span> 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That will <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough">create</a> all the necessary infrastructure components you need for your cluster.
They will be referenced as resources in your Azure Dashboard and will be part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyResourceGroup</code> which is the specify group.
The name of the cluster can’t be change later.</p>

<div class="row">
    
    <div style="flex: 100.0%">
        <img class="single" src="/assets/img/azure-dashboard.png" alt="azure-dashboard.png" />
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>Once created (it can take a couple of minutes) you can access your Kubernetes cluster via your PC,
or using the Azure Cloud Terminal (available as Bash or Powershell) with all the tools already installed.</p>

<h3 id="add-rbac-with-azure-ad">Add RBAC with Azure AD</h3>

<p>You can use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) with an addition with the Azure Active Directory.
That way you can fine tune what users can do within your cluster.</p>

<p>You can update your cluster with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/managed-aad">Azure Active Directory (aad)</a> or create a new cluster. 
Here is how you should do to update your cluster with a newly created AD group:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Create your AD Group</span>
az ad group create <span class="nt">--display-name</span> myAKSAdminGroup <span class="nt">--mail-nickname</span> myAKSAdminGroup
az aks update <span class="nt">-g</span> MyResourceGroup <span class="nt">-n</span> MyManagedCluster <span class="nt">--enable-aad</span> <span class="nt">--aad-admin-group-object-ids</span> &lt;id-1&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That step is not mandatory but good to know that it is possible to secure even further your cluster.
One of the good point of Azure its all the possibility it provides, 
but it also be quiet complex to get a full understanding at the whole architecture and component in azure.
You may need to get credentials so you can access your Kubernetes:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>az aks get-credentials <span class="nt">--resource-group</span> MyResourceGroup <span class="nt">--name</span> MyManagedCluster
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then it should be all traditional Kubernetes/helm commands to update your cluster.
And that’s the good thing about it, you don’t need to learn new special commands to manage your cluster,
you can still use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubectl</code>.</p>

<h2 id="get-started-with-your-kubernetes-cluster">Get started with your Kubernetes Cluster</h2>

<h3 id="create-new-deployment">Create new deployment</h3>

<p>Apply new deployment using yaml file instead of the GUI using:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kubectl apply <span class="nt">-f</span> deployment.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are using an Azure registry to store your artifacts and docker images, you can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad?view=azure-cli-latest">Azure CLI</a> 
to attach it to your deployment using with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">azureRegistry</code> the name of the registry:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>az aks update <span class="nt">--resource-group</span> MyResourceGroup <span class="nt">--name</span> MyManagedCluster <span class="nt">--attach-acr</span> registryAzure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That way you can pull images from your own registry and have your pods created.
Once done, it should also be all be visible in the GUI</p>

<h3 id="view-created-resources-on-the-portal">View created resources on the Portal</h3>

<p>Talking about the GUI once you have some pods, services and else, you can click on kubernetes resources and select one.
You then have some visualization options there on the side (Yaml, Events, Changelog)</p>

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/assets/img/azure-k8resources.png" alt="azure-k8resources.png" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/assets/img/azure-deployment.png" alt="azure-deployment.png" />
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>All these info can be viewed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubectl describe</code> but it’s still cool to have it there as well.
In case you lost the file, or want to check the deployment from the GUI.
Also you will see that a lot of Azure stuff will be added to your deployment Yaml files (timestamp, uuid, …).</p>

<h3 id="add-metrics-for-monitoring">Add metrics for monitoring</h3>

<p>Once you have a couple pods, you can create default metrics charts from the Monitoring panel in your dashboard from your kubernetes cluster.
It has basic pods and cpu information.
Still on the monitoring side you have access to a broad range of features like Alerts, Logs, and other diagnostic tools.</p>

<div class="row">
    
    <div style="flex: 100.0%">
        <img class="single" src="/assets/img/azure-metrics.png" alt="azure-metrics.png" />
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>But that’s not all, you can also configure a prometheus instance and plug it to your cluster for added functionality.
For that you can use some <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/">prometheus exporters</a> with a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-prometheus-integration">prometheus container</a>
or directly through the Azure Monitor so that you can <em>scrap</em> the metrics and display them.</p>
