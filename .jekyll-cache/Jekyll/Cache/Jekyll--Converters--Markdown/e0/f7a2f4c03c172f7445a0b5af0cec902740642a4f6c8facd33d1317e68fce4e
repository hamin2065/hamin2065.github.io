<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics in whatever agile methodology you choose to use are not meant for higher management, but rather as a tool for the team to auto evaluate and improve recursively.</p>

<p>It is recommended to implement early on metrics (chosen by the team) in order to get feedback on your process. It can be good indicator of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Sprint health (changes in the sprint backlog)</li>
  <li>The number of blocked item</li>
  <li>The waiting time of an issue (time is stays in a particular column)</li>
  <li>The WIP (work in progress), the amount of task currently in progress</li>
  <li>The elapsed time of an issue (time between the creation and the completion)</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will help take decisions during the daily scrum on how the team is doing. 
It is also a key component during the retrospective where you can comment and take action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the root cause of a sudden drop in a metric</li>
  <li>Add a new metric to monitor a new aspect</li>
  <li>Remove old metric that are not relevant anymore</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="burntdown">Burntdown</h4>

<p>Sprint Burntdown chart, how to evaluate the work that has been done (based on the story points) compared with the remaining amount of time. 
It is the most used metric for the SCRUM framework.</p>
