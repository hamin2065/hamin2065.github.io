I"<h2 id="i-definition">I. Definition</h2>

<p>Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.</p>

<p>When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the <em>relative values</em>. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated as 3 story points.</p>

<h3 id="what-goes-into-a-story-point">What Goes Into a Story Point</h3>

<p>Because story points represent the effort to develop a story, a team‚Äôs estimate must include everything that can affect the effort. That could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The amount of work to do</li>
  <li>The complexity of the work</li>
  <li>Any risk or uncertainty in doing the work</li>
</ul>

<p>When estimating with story points, be sure to consider each of these factors.</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Estimates allows to predict when a substantial increment of value will be delivered</li>
  <li>Estimates help our stakeholders plan ahead. It is part of the value we provide.</li>
  <li>Estimates can de-risk scope of uncertain size and complexity</li>
  <li>Estimated work can be traded in and out of scope for other work of similar size. Without estimates you can‚Äôt trade.</li>
  <li>Estimating a task brings value, because its process involves more details and understanding of the requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Estimates can be inaccurate and set false expectations</li>
  <li>Estimation can be seen as commitment which could be use against yourself</li>
  <li>Estimation is time consuming</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="poker-planning">Poker Planning</h3>

<p>A typical Planning Poker set has cards with the following numbers: ÔøΩ 1 2 3 5 8 13 20 40 100.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everybody has the same amount of cards</li>
  <li>They draw one of these card to measure a the backlog item first presented by the PO</li>
  <li>The lower and higher numbers explain there reason</li>
  <li>The process is repeated until the team agrees, then we pass on to the next card</li>
</ul>

<p>When the number on the card is 20 or higher, it either need to be broken down, or sent back to the Product owner for more explanation.</p>

<p>Poker planning is fairly democratic but can be rather time consuming.</p>

<h3 id="t-shirt-size">T-Shirt Size</h3>

<p>Here you need a scale of ‚Äút-shirt size‚Äù: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The scale is put on table horizontally, you need to have the backlog item written down</li>
  <li>The team starts with one item of the backlog and discuss where to put it on the scale</li>
  <li>They can ask for information to the product Owner</li>
  <li>Once the size has been decided, we can add the Story Points according to the size</li>
</ul>

      <td>Extra Large</td>
      <td>XL</td>
      <td>8</td>

      <td>Extra Extra Large</td>

<p>Easily set up, different way of implementing it, less arguing on numbers.</p>

<h3 id="one-point-one-card">One Point One card</h3>

<p>This method consist of using one story point per backlog item.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The prediction is based on the previous sprint, the team is more likely to finish the same amount of task than last time</li>
  <li>The velocity is calculated via the number of stories per sprint</li>
</ul>

<p>This method is very simple. Sprint goal may be separated from business value and risky items won‚Äôt be identified through points.</p>
