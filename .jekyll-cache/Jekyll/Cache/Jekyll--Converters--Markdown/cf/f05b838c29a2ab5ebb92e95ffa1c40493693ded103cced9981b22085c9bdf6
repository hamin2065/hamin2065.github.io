I"è<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The facebook <a href="https://fbctf.com/">CTF</a> kick started on the 1st of June to the 3rd of July. It was apparently using <a href="https://ctfd.io/">ctfd.io</a>
which is a platform to host ctfs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/fb-challenges.png" alt="vision" /></p>

<p>The challenges were separated into 5 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reversing: Usually a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tar</code> to download and exploit</li>
  <li>pwnable: Some server you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> in, with sometime provided the source code of the application</li>
  <li>crypto: Different type of crypto challenges</li>
  <li>misc: Very broad that did not fit elsewhere</li>
  <li>web: Challenges with a link to a web page where the flag was to be be uncovered.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="points-and-scoreboard">Points and scoreboard</h2>

<p>Something interesting here, the points for a challenge were decreasing each time somebody would solve it. 
Starting at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000</code> when the challenge is release, it slowly goes down to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code> once 100 persons solve it (at first it was 300).
Once at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code> the points of the flag was not going lower. Hence the faster you find the solution of a flag the more points you score.</p>

<p>The winner was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visit g.co/ctf </code>, the sole member was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g+</code> aka let me guess Google +. 
They might have been trolling the event to promote their ctf on the 22th of June 2019.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges were diverse, you had to click on them and a window would pop with some context and a box to submit the flag.
Each challenge have only one flag that can be submitted.</p>

<p>The easter egg flag was hidden in the career page (you had to look for letters in white within the text to find it).
A simple search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{</code> in each page would have been necessary to get the flag. Here is a command to get it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">--silent</span> <span class="s1">'https://fbctf.com/careers'</span> | egrep <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;span style=</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">color:white</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">&gt;.{1}"</span> | <span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="s2">"s/&lt;span style=</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">color:white</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">&gt;//g"</span> | <span class="nb">tr</span> <span class="s1">'\n'</span> <span class="s1">' '</span>

f b <span class="o">{</span> w e <span class="s1">' r e _ h i r i n g }
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>However the first flag was an easy one to get to know how theyâ€™d look like I guess <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fb{move_fast_and_hack_things}</code>. 
It was in the IRC:</p>

<p>All in all it was fun to try some challenges, and when seeing how fast some advancing in the challenges, 
it makes me feel that there are still a lot of things to learn.</p>
